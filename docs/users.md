## User 1: Researchers
Understanding how current technology can predict severity of brain tumor from early-stage brain tumor imaging.
Through website/dashboard, by uploading patient brain images, researchers will get a prediction of the severity of the brain tumor. Further research can be done to increase accuracy and/or add new features
Would be interested in the code too: add more train/test data (more brain images); update algorithms; make additional code iterations as scope increases. 



## User 2: Patient
Cyndi just received her diagnosis with a brain tumor at the age of 30. She received her MRI results that showed a tumor in the early stage of development. Instead of waiting for more information from the doctor, she would like to know more about her diagnosis. What’s the size of the tumor? What’s the severity of her condition?


## User 3:Doctors
Jane is a doctor.

Jane wants to verify that she’s correctly identified the tumor region.

She wants to submit a brain scan and have the predicted tumor size and predicted severity annotated. 

She wants to supplement her own expertise with a tool that will confirm whether her own analysis is valid.

Jane’s doesn’t have technical expertise and wants an easy-to-use interface and a simple output that gives essential information in a clean format.
