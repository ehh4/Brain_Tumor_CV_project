### Brain Tumor Identification using Computer Vision Techniques (Instance and Sementics Segmentation)

<b>The project type:</b> Create a tool\
<b>The questions of interest:</b>\
With the brain tumor images, we want to explore computer vision methods such as instance and semantics segmentation to recognize/predict the different probability or severity of tumor presence given a brain medical image.\
<b>The goal for the project output:</b>\
An online website/tool where potential patients can upload their brain scan images and weâ€™ll return the likelihood/severity of the brain tumor. Although that cannot serve as the ultimate truth, we can encourage patients to seek professional help.\
<b>The data sources you will use:</b>\
[Medical Image DataSet: Brain Tumor Detections](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/medical-image-dataset-brain-tumor-detection)\
[Brain Tumor Image DataSet: Instance Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/medical-image-dataset-brain-tumor-segmentation)\
[Brain Tumor Image DataSet : Semantic Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/brain-tumor-image-dataset-semantic-segmentation)



<b>Notes:</b>
A few related models/datasets:\
[A Complete ML Pipeline FastAI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/qitvision/a-complete-ml-pipeline-fast-ai)\
Uses fast.ai to identify cancer in scans. Example of semantics\
Fast.ai is an easy to use model that requires less parameter tuning and model customization\
Also gives an example of image augmentation using OpenCV\
Five year old example\
[Buiding a CNN Example](https://www.kaggle.com/code/fmarazzi/baseline-keras-cnn-roc-fast-10min-0-925-lb)\
Quick example using keras\
An example of building a CNN model\
Another 5 year old example
