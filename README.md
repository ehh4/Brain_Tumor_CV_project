Brain Tumor Detection Tool Using Computer Vision Techniques
====================
As the field of deep learning continues to grow, we are interested in its application within healthcare, particularly in the realm of brain tumor detection and classification based on brain CT scans. Our project objective is to develop a user-friendly website catering to a diverse audience, including researchers, patients, doctors, and interested users in general. The platform's primary functionality involves allowing users to upload brain CT scans and receive predictions regarding the presence of a tumor and its severity. Other features of this website includes a background introduction of brain tumors, its symptoms and signs, and resources to further explore the topics.
As a stretch goal, we envision incorporating an interactive chatbot into the website. This chatbot would serve as a guide, directing users to relevant pages and, ideally, facilitating the upload of images for predictions within the chat interface. This feature not only enhances user engagement but also provides an intuitive and seamless experience for individuals seeking information or diagnostic insights.
